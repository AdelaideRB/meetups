# Talks

We hold monthly meetups on the first Tuesday of the month, where we have talks around Ruby, Rails, and anything even slightly related. It's a friendly, open place for discussion between developers of all levels of experience.

We usually meet at Marjoan located at Level 2, 14 Grenfell St, (above Harryâ€™s Bar).

We're currently trying out github issues as a means for requesting, proposing, and disussion talk ideas.
